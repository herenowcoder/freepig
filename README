freepig = ports indexing graph for freebsd

==========================================

This is a proof-of-concept - or proof-of-disaster - implementation of
a convenient graph describing FreeBSD ports and their dependencies.

Think of it as FreeBSD's version of the original pig [1] which was
created to speed up macports.
The motivation for using such piece of code is similar as with [2].



It may mutate in the future into graphs for other package managers
to speed up things on Linux distrubutions as well.


Stay tuned.
